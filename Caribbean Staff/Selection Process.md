## Overview

While each position has individual requirements which vary from facility to facility, the divisional positions tend to share some common traits. Some of the things we look at when selecting our divisional team include:

- Real-world experience in the desired position.
- VATSIM experience in related staff positions.
- Length of time on the VATSIM network.
- Network activity. (based on hours and locations)
- Network standing. (no disciplinary issues in the past 2 years)
- Typically hold an S3 rating or higher.
- Be at least 16 years of age or older at the time the application is submitted. (18+ preferred)

## Interview Process

VATCAR utilizes a three-step interview process. Once we receive an application, the Deputy Division Director will conduct a general evaluation and provide the results to the Board of Directors. An initial meeting will take place to decide if an interview is warranted. If so, an invitation will go out to the candidate and they will be invited to interview with the Deputy Division Director. The candidate will receive an email within 24 hours of the initial interview informing the candidate if they will be moving on to the next step or if the application will be closed. If recommended, the candidate will have a second interview before the entire board or a one-on-one interview with the Division Director. Finally, the Board of Directors will vote to accept or reject the prospective candidate. Board votes need not be unanimous.

## Positions Affected

All Divisional positions are required to complete the interview process described above. The following sub-divisional positions will require divisional review and approval for all candidates: Air Traffic Manager, Deputy Air Traffic Manager, and Training Administrator.

Please note, that the Board of Directors does NOT manage or interview candidates for sub-divisional positions. The board will only review perspective candidates presented by the facilityâ€™s Air Traffic Manager.

## Sub-Divisional

All other sub-divisional positions up to and including mentors and assistants will NOT require divisional review.
