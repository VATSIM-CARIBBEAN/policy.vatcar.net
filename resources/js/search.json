An Official FIR will normally also include a Training Administrator (Instructor/Examiner), who is able to issue “Recommendations” to VATCAR’s Training Director for Controller Upgrades, following performed Controller Practical Tests (CPTs). An Official FIR must provide, through its website, the necessary information for virtual Pilots and ATCs to operate within its Airspace. This should include:","An overview of all Official FIRs are displayed on VATCAR’s webpage","Brief visiting pilots on procedures, and Communicate with VATCAR regarding local matters","Coordinate ATC operations within their airspace","Coordinate training of new members","Downloadable charts","Each FIR’s is free to generate, update and replace facility policies and/or regulations. Any changes or revisions will have to be approved by VATCAR before becoming official. This approval requires the vote of VATCAR1, VATCAR2 and VATCAR3. Each FIR is also free to organize its internal events, but for best purposes, we recommend events be coordinated via VATCAR 6 – Events Coordinator in advance. This step will help to insure order and promote the event across multiple VATCAR and VATSIM Services.","FIR information (routes, navigation, regulations)","Link to related Virtual Aviation and Controlling websites","Maintain archives of required material for Pilots and ATC within their airspace","Member lists","Organize events","Other downloads (e.g. sector files, POF-files, scenery information, etc)","Staff member lists (contact information)","Training Department (custom tutorials, with links to other training material)"]}],[{"l":"PURPOSE","p":["The VATSIM Caribbean Division Open Skies Program is designed to offer controllers a chance to control facilities within the VATSIM Caribbean Division that barely receive any coverage due to a lack of home controllers and a lack of members to run a facility staff.","The Open Skies Program opens up these facilities to any controller interested in controlling there, as long as they hold the appropriate ATC rating for the position they want to control and are on the Open Skies Controller Roster."]},{"l":"DEFINITION","p":["Facilities may be considered for the Open Skies Program when multiple of the following conditions apply.","– Lack of active facility members.","– Lack of facility ATC coverage.","– Lack of active facility staff.","– Lack of people to fill facility staff vacancies.","A facility can only be added or removed from the Open Skies Program at the sole discretion of the VATSIM Caribbean Division Director.

In addition, all controllers need to hold an S3 (Student 3) rating or higher to apply. Once a controller is on the roster, no further restrictions apply and the controller is allowed to control any position within the Open Skies Program facilities as long as they hold the appropriate ATC rating for that specific position."]},{"l":"CONTROLLER ROSTER","p":["The Open Skies Controller Roster shall be maintained by the VATSIM Caribbean Division, listing all controllers that have been accepted to control facilities part of the Open Skies Program in VATCAR. Controllers are expected to provide ATC services at facilities part of the Open Skies Program for at least 3 hours every 90 days. Controllers that do not meet this requirement shall be removed from the Open Skies Roster and will need to reapply."]},{"l":"CONTROLLER TRAINING","p":["There is no training program for facilities that are part of the Open Skies Program and no training will be provided. Instead, sector files and documentation shall be provided by the VATSIM Caribbean Division outlining standard operating procedures for the facilities. There are no written or practical exams that controllers are required to take before they can control a facility part of the Open Skies Program. Controllers are expected to become acquainted with facilities by studying the provided documentation before opening a position within a facility as part of the Open Skies Program."]},{"l":"APPROVING AUTHORITY","p":["The Open Skies Program is authorized for use by the VATCAR1, VATCAR2, and VATCAR3."]}],[{"l":"Standard Operations","p":["Despite our efforts to maintain a high level of real-world realism, any proposed change to operations, frequencies in use, and/or airspace, will have to be reviewed by VATCAR3. This requirement will ensure that a new set of rules, even if it is based on real-world changes, do not interfere with surrounding FIR’s operations.","Voice restrictions, based on the controller level, do not apply within VATCAR. Each controller who provides voice services must assure that his voice server IP is distributed to clients via his radar client software. In case the radar client software requires the voice IP to be entered manually, the voice IP must be the first line of the Controller’s ATIS, enabling pilot clients to identify the voice IP as quickly as possible.","Text ATC remains active as the secondary mode of communication, and every pilot and controller must be able to exercise this if needed. Pilots must be tuned to their controller’s text ATC frequency (COM1) in FlightSimulator, even if they intend to use voice. Voice ATC is primarily, to aid speed, ease, and realism of communications, but sometimes for various reasons, like voice connectivity problems, text-only communications have to be used."]}],[{"l":"Special Operations","p":["Military Flights are allowed within VATCAR, as long as they:","Do not interfere with civilian flights","Are not on combat missions","Do not interfere with politically sensitive matters and/or areas in the real world","Do not have a political message passed by their activity","Must follow standard IFR or VFR routes, or","May follow different routes only after controller’s approval (if present)","Aerial refueling, formation flying, precision approach, cargo, and similar flights are allowed by VATSIM approved special operations communities found listed on the VATSIM website. Aircraft type does not matter as long as the above rules are followed.","ATC should request the “purpose” of the flight’s mission. If the response from the “Flight leader” does not seem to be in accordance with the above, then records should be taken (VATSIM ID, radar snapshots, callsigns, etc), and be reported to the DCRM for further action. Online verbal conflicts must be avoided.","Emergency simulations are at the sole discretion of the highest active ATC position. At the request of ATC or Supervisory personnel, ATCs may deny an emergency, particularly to prevent delays to other pilots or during heavy traffic periods. Emergencies are usually not welcomed during fly-ins. If an emergency is denied (and the pilot is unable to resume normal flight), then the pilot shall immediately disconnect from the network."]}],[{"l":"Special Task Assignments","p":["When necessary, and under VATCAR interests, a Special Task Assignment (STA) can be delivered to one or more VATCAR members. This STA will act only for predetermined issues previously announced and assigned by VATCAR1."]}],[{"l":"Controller Activity","p":["VATCAR fully understands that we all have commitments to the real world (work, school, family, etc) we will always remain sensitive to this. However, we must also strike a balance between this hobby and these commitments. As we all know, ATC is a constantly evolving environment with New procedures, changes in policies, and needed proficiency. The following policy was put in place in an attempt to be sensitive to all of this while ensuring we maintain a roster with a proficient controller base. The VATCAR Controller Hour Policy is officially in place and FIR Air Traffic Managers will be verifying controller hours monthly. If you feel you’re unable to meet the monthly requirements you will need to contact your FIR Staff so they are aware. Failure to do so will result in removal from your FIR Roster.","A VATCAR home controller with an ATC rating of S1, S2, S3, C1, or higher has the right to provide ATC services on the VATSIM network provided the community member is listed on a facility roster and considered “active” on that facility roster. In order to remain “active” VATCAR controllers must control a minimum of 3 hours per calendar quarter. Any member listed on a facility roster with the rating of “OBS” is required to seek training via his/her facility training team. If you are unable to maintain the minimum 3-hour requirement, please get in touch with your facility Air Traffic Manager to request a Leave of Absence.","Divisional level staff members, including Air Traffic Managers, may be exempted from these requirements for a period no greater than 180 days.
