We hope you find this material helpful, and look forward to participating with you soon."]}],[{"l":"Controller Activity","p":["VATCAR fully understands that we all have commitments to the real world (work, school, family, etc) we will always remain sensitive to this. However, we must also strike a balance between this hobby and these commitments. As we all know, ATC is a constantly evolving environment with New procedures, changes in policies, and needed proficiency. The following policy was put in place in an attempt to be sensitive to all of this while ensuring we maintain a roster with a proficient controller base. The VATCAR Controller Hour Policy is officially in place and FIR Air Traffic Managers will be verifying controller hours monthly. If you feel you’re unable to meet the monthly requirements you will need to contact your FIR Staff so they are aware. Failure to do so will result in removal from your FIR Roster.","A VATCAR home controller with an ATC rating of S1, S2, S3, C1, or higher has the right to provide ATC services on the VATSIM network provided the community member is listed on a facility roster and considered “active” on that facility roster. In order to remain “active” VATCAR controllers must control a minimum of 3 hours per calendar quarter. Any member listed on a facility roster with the rating of “OBS” is required to seek training via his/her facility training team. If you are unable to maintain the minimum 3-hour requirement, please get in touch with your facility Air Traffic Manager to request a Leave of Absence.","Divisional level staff members, including Air Traffic Managers, may be exempted from these requirements for a period no greater than 180 days. Staff hours may be used in place of network activity at the discretion of the Caribbean Division Director."]}],[{"l":"Transferring Controllers","p":["Transfers to VATCAR can happen for several reasons and in several ways. Let’s take a closer look at how you can successfully complete your transfer request.","Do I meet the requirements to visit?","Your transfer application will be rejected if the answer is NO to any of the above. Please note that a rejection will only further delay your ability to transfer in the future. If, however, the answer is YES to all of the above, please select the transfer method that applies to you below.","How to transfer from a different VATSIM Region? You can change your region by visiting https://my.vatsim.net/user/region. You will need to select Americas as a new region and VATCAR as a new division. You will also need to provide a reason for the transfer. Once your transfer is processed, you will be able to join an FIR of your choice by visiting https://qre.zro.mybluehost.me/website_33b1edad/join/ and selecting a facility.","How to transfer from an Americas Division? If you are already a member of VATSIM Americas, You can change your division by emailing your current divisional director and vatcar1@qre.zro.mybluehost.me.

Once processed, you will be able to join an FIR of your choice by visiting https://qre.zro.mybluehost.me/website_33b1edad/join/ and selecting a facility.","I am a visitor; how do I become a home controller? You will need to look at both of the options above. Choose the path that best fits your current situation. Please note, that some VATCAR sub-division may require or waive additional training from its visitors becoming home controllers. Be sure to reference facility materials for complete details. If you need assistance, please contact VATCAR1 for more guidance in completing your transfer request."]}],[{"l":"Visiting Controllers","p":["NOTAM Effective 10 March 2024, All VATCAR visiting controllers must hold an S3 rating or higher. Current S1/S2 visiting controllers have until 1 June 2024 to obtain an S3 rating in order to retain visiting status within VATCAR.","Visiting Requirements:","Must hold an S3 rating or higher. Do I have at least 50 hours on an ATC position corresponding to my current rating, at my home facility? Has maintained an “ACTIVE” controller status in the last two quarters. Has at least 50% of total controlling hours at the home facility. Has had no disciplinary problems within VATSIM in the last year.","Visiting controllers agree to maintain a minimum of three controlling hours per quarter. We remind you that you must maintain 50% of your total hours at your home facility. This means you can also control your time at home for at least three hours.","Intradivisional Visiting: Currently, the Caribbean Division does not allow S1/S2 controllers to visit adjacent subdivisional facilities."]}],[{"l":"Leave of Absence","p":["Upon request, a facility Air Traffic Manager may grant a leave of absence status for a period of at least 4 months, which may be extended to no more than 8 months. The total time of leave of absence may not exceed 8 months in any 2-year period. Persons on LOA may cancel their LOA and return to active duty at any time.","Any ATM, who wishes to have someone remain as LOA for any other reason such as real-world consultancy etc, must be approved by VATCAR1 and VATCAR2. However, members who have been granted LOA and have been found to be logging hours on the network controlling or flying, are subject to their LOA being revoked and possible removal due to inactivity from their FIR.","Note – LOAs are only valid for VATCAR Home Controllers. Any Visiting Controllers unable to maintain “active” status will forfeit visiting rights and may reapply at a later date. We encourage visitors to communicate with the facility’s Air Traffic Manager to keep them informed of any such changes."]}],[{"l":"Suspensions","p":["Disciplinary action may be taken against a member, if a Supervisor performs a 48 hours temporary suspension, or if an Air Traffic Manager requests it from the VATCAR DCRM. VATCAR’s official Policy on this issue is in full compliance with VATSIM Code of Regulations & Code of Conduct. The VATCAR DCRM is in charge of administering such procedures, as stated above.","Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence. The DCRM will soon decide the penalty, further suspension or not, and inform all parties involved. If the suspended member disagrees, then he/she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Region RCRP, who will make the final decision.","The DCRM will also be called upon in case of a Supervisor suspension of a user, for determination of guilt and suspension application (if required). User cooperation with the DCRM is a requirement for VATSIM membership, and refusal to cooperate may result in suspension. For further information on disciplinary procedures, please read the VATSIM Code of Regulations & Code of Conduct. A member may be suspended for 24 or 48 hours by a Supervisor for acting illegally within VATSIM Network. The DCRM will automatically be notified of 48-hour suspensions, and soon after that, the suspending Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence. The DCRM will soon decide the penalty, further suspension or not, and inform all parties involved. If the suspended member disagrees, then he/she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Region RCRP, who will make the final decision."]}]]
