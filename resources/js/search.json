We hope you find this material helpful, and look forward to participating with you soon."]}],[{"l":"Controller Activity","p":["VATCAR fully understands that we all have commitments to the real world (work, school, family, etc) we will always remain sensitive to this. However, we must also strike a balance between this hobby and these commitments. As we all know, ATC is a constantly evolving environment with New procedures, changes in policies, and needed proficiency. The following policy was put in place in an attempt to be sensitive to all of this while ensuring we maintain a roster with a proficient controller base. The VATCAR Controller Hour Policy is officially in place and FIR Air Traffic Managers will be verifying controller hours monthly. If you feel you’re unable to meet the monthly requirements you will need to contact your FIR Staff so they are aware. Failure to do so will result in removal from your FIR Roster.","A VATCAR home controller with an ATC rating of S1, S2, S3, C1, or higher has the right to provide ATC services on the VATSIM network provided the community member is listed on a facility roster and considered “active” on that facility roster. In order to remain “active” VATCAR controllers must control a minimum of 3 hours per calendar quarter. Any member listed on a facility roster with the rating of “OBS” is required to seek training via his/her facility training team. If you are unable to maintain the minimum 3-hour requirement, please get in touch with your facility Air Traffic Manager to request a Leave of Absence.","Divisional level staff members, including Air Traffic Managers, may be exempted from these requirements for a period no greater than 180 days. Staff hours may be used in place of network activity at the discretion of the Caribbean Division Director."]}],[{"l":"Transferring Controllers","p":["Transfers to VATCAR can happen for several reasons and in several ways. Let’s take a closer look at how you can successfully complete your transfer request.","Has it been at least 90 days since my last rating change?","Do I have at least 50 hours on an ATC position corresponding to my current rating, at my home facility?","Has it been at least 90 days since my last transfer request?","If the last transfer request was rejected, had it been at least 90 days since the rejection notice?","Your transfer application will be rejected if the answer is NO to any of the above. Please note that a rejection will only further delay your ability to transfer in the future. If, however, the answer is YES to all of the above, please select the transfer method that applies to you below.","You can change your region by visiting https://my.vatsim.net/user/region. You will need to select Americas as a new region and VATCAR as a new division. You will also need to provide a reason for the transfer. Once your transfer is processed, you will be able to join an FIR of your choice by visiting https://vatcar.net and selecting a facility.","If you are already a member of VATSIM Americas, You can change your division by emailing your current divisional director and vatcar1@vatcar.net. You will need to provide a reason for the transfer and wait for your transfer to be processed.

The total time of leave of absence may not exceed 8 months in any 2-year period. Persons on LOA may cancel their LOA and return to active duty at any time.","Any ATM, who wishes to have someone remain as LOA for any other reason such as real-world consultancy etc, must be approved by VATCAR1 and VATCAR2. However, members who have been granted LOA and have been found to be logging hours on the network controlling or flying, are subject to their LOA being revoked and possible removal due to inactivity from their FIR.","LOAs are only valid for VATCAR Home Controllers. Any Visiting Controllers unable to maintain “active” status will forfeit visiting rights and may reapply at a later date.

The VATCAR DCRM is in charge of administering such procedures, as stated above.","Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence. The DCRM will soon decide the penalty, further suspension or not, and inform all parties involved. If the suspended member disagrees, then he/she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Region RCRP, who will make the final decision.","The DCRM will also be called upon in case of a Supervisor suspension of a user, for determination of guilt and suspension application (if required). User cooperation with the DCRM is a requirement for VATSIM membership, and refusal to cooperate may result in suspension. For further information on disciplinary procedures, please read the VATSIM Code of Regulations & Code of Conduct. A member may be suspended for 24 or 48 hours by a Supervisor for acting illegally within VATSIM Network. The DCRM will automatically be notified of 48-hour suspensions, and soon after that, the suspending Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence.

VATSIM further encourages controllers to consider the popularity of any given client within a division when making their selection. This is in an effort to facilitate your training and development as a Virtual Air Traffic Controller. In that spirit, we at VATCAR are aligning our policies and procedures.","In order to standardize and facilitate training, all VATCAR controllers, both home and visiting, are required to complete all training sessions via the use of the Euroscope Air Traffic Control Client. For example:","Initial Training Sessions","Advance Training Sessions","Remedial Training Sessions","Over The Shoulder Exams","Visitor Check-Outs","Individual Endorsements","Although VATCAR requires that all training sessions and evaluations occur via the Euroscope ATC Client; Air Traffic Managers may individually recommend a preferred client within a sub-division. During normal operations controllers may choose to use any VATSIM approved ATC Client provided the controller ensures the use of up-to-date sector, pof, and alias files.","The following is a list of VATCAR approved ATC Clients:","Euroscope (preferred)","CRC","VatSys","VRC (unsupported)"]}],[{"l":"Divisional Staff"},{"l":"Overview","p":["VATCAR Staff members (Callsign “VATCARx”, where x denotes the staff position) are listed on the Caribbean Division’s Staff page.

An initial meeting will take place to decide if an interview is warranted. If so, an invitation will go out to the candidate and they will be invited to interview with the Deputy Division Director. The candidate will receive an email within 24 hours of the initial interview informing the candidate if they will be moving on to the next step or if the application will be closed. If recommended, the candidate will have a second interview before the entire board or a one-on-one interview with the Division Director. Finally, the Board of Directors will vote to accept or reject the prospective candidate. Board votes need not be unanimous."]},{"l":"Positions Affected","p":["All Divisional positions are required to complete the interview process described above.

The Caribbean Board of Directors will vote on the removal of an Air Traffic Manager."]}],[{"l":"Tower View","p":["What is a tower view?","Tower view is a system designed to allow controllers to view real-time network activity via his or her preferred flight simulator software. It provides controllers with a 3D view of a 2D radar scope.","What do I need?","You must choose your preferred ATC client, your preferred Flight Simulator, and the corresponding connection clients (Audio For Vatsim, vPilot, xPilot, Swift, etc.)","How does it work?","Ultimately the simplest explanation is that one system (typically the ATC client) establishes a connection to VATSIM and establishes a proxy server. The connection client will make a connection to the proxy server and inject the network traffic into the flight simulator. That said, various platforms exist with different connection methods.","Getting started","This tutorial assumes you have installed the EuroScope ATC client, Audio For Vatsim, and either vPilot or xPilot depending on your preferred Flight Simulator.","Connecting","Step 1- Open your flight simulator and position yourself at your local airport. (If necessary, we recommend using a default GA aircraft and positioning it at a remote gate or ramp when tower positions are not an option)","Step 2- Open EuroScope, Go to Quick Set, and Select Enable advanced proxy communication.","Step 3- In EuroSope click to open the connection dialog, Choose Start Proxy Server, and Click Connect.","Step 4- Open Audio For Vatsim and connect normally. (you are now controlling the selected position)","Step 5- Open either vPilot or xPilot and in the command line type .towerview (this will trigger a connection to the proxy server and show your cid_tv as a callsign)","Enjoy!"]}]]
