To the extent possible, VATCAR strives to prevent conflicts and disputes from reaching a point that detracts from our activities or results in disciplinary action. It is not the intention of VATCAR to be involved in “personality conflicts”. However, if disputes do become disruptive in nature, or if specific complaints are brought forward, then VATCAR5, the Division Conflict Resolution Manager (herein DCRM), may intervene, or be asked to intervene.
