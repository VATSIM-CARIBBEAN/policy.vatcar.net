Disciplinary action may be taken against a member, if a Supervisor performs a 48 hours temporary suspension, or if an Air Traffic Manager requests it from the VATCAR DCRM. VATCARâ€™s official Policy on this issue is in full compliance with VATSIM Code of Regulations & Code of Conduct. The VATCAR DCRM is in charge of administering such procedures, as stated above.

Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence. The DCRM will soon decide the penalty, further suspension or not, and inform all parties involved. If the suspended member disagrees, then he/she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Region RCRP, who will make the final decision.

The DCRM will also be called upon in case of a Supervisor suspension of a user, for determination of guilt and suspension application (if required). User cooperation with the DCRM is a requirement for VATSIM membership, and refusal to cooperate may result in suspension. For further information on disciplinary procedures, please read the VATSIM Code of Regulations & Code of Conduct. A member may be suspended for 24 or 48 hours by a Supervisor for acting illegally within VATSIM Network. The DCRM will automatically be notified of 48-hour suspensions, and soon after that, the suspending Supervisor and the suspended member may be called upon by the DCRM to give further evidence. The DCRM will soon decide the penalty, further suspension or not, and inform all parties involved. If the suspended member disagrees, then he/she still has the right to appeal the decision to the Region RCRP, who will make the final decision.
