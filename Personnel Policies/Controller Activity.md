VATCAR fully understands that we all have commitments to the real world (work, school, family, etc) we will always remain sensitive to this. However, we must also strike a balance between this hobby and these commitments. As we all know, ATC is a constantly evolving environment with New procedures, changes in policies, and needed proficiency. The following policy was put in place in an attempt to be sensitive to all of this while ensuring we maintain a roster with a proficient controller base. The VATCAR Controller Hour Policy is officially in place and FIR Air Traffic Managers will be verifying controller hours monthly. If you feel you’re unable to meet the monthly requirements you will need to contact your FIR Staff so they are aware. Failure to do so will result in removal from your FIR Roster.

A VATCAR home controller with an ATC rating of S1, S2, S3, C1, or higher has the right to provide ATC services on the VATSIM network provided the community member is listed on a facility roster and considered “active” on that facility roster. In order to remain “active” VATCAR controllers must control a minimum of 3 hours per calendar quarter. Any member listed on a facility roster with the rating of “OBS” is required to seek training via his/her facility training team. If you are unable to maintain the minimum 3-hour requirement, please get in touch with your facility Air Traffic Manager to request a Leave of Absence.

!!!
Divisional level staff members, including Air Traffic Managers, may be exempted from these requirements for a period no greater than 180 days. Staff hours may be used in place of network activity at the discretion of the Caribbean Division Director.
