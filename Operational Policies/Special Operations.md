Military Flights are allowed within VATCAR, as long as they:

- Do not interfere with civilian flights
- Are not on combat missions
- Do not interfere with politically sensitive matters and/or areas in the real world
- Do not have a political message passed by their activity
- Must follow standard IFR or VFR routes, or
- May follow different routes only after controller’s approval (if present)
- Aerial refueling, formation flying, precision approach, cargo, and similar flights are allowed by VATSIM approved special operations communities found listed on the VATSIM website. Aircraft type does not matter as long as the above rules are followed.

ATC should request the “purpose” of the flight’s mission. If the response from the “Flight leader” does not seem to be in accordance with the above, then records should be taken (VATSIM ID, radar snapshots, callsigns, etc), and be reported to the DCRM for further action. Online verbal conflicts must be avoided.

Emergency simulations are at the sole discretion of the highest active ATC position. At the request of ATC or Supervisory personnel, ATCs may deny an emergency, particularly to prevent delays to other pilots or during heavy traffic periods. Emergencies are usually not welcomed during fly-ins. If an emergency is denied (and the pilot is unable to resume normal flight), then the pilot shall immediately disconnect from the network.
