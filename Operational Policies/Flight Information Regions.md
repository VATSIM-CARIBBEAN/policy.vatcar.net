An FIR is a local organization serving a specific area within the Division, and established within VATCAR to perform the following roles:

- Coordinate training of new members
- Maintain archives of required material for Pilots and ATC within their airspace
- Coordinate ATC operations within their airspace
- Organize events
- Brief visiting pilots on procedures, and Communicate with VATCAR regarding local matters

An Official FIR must be directed by a member with a minimum rating of “Controller”. An Official FIR will normally also include a Training Administrator (Instructor/Examiner), who is able to issue “Recommendations” to VATCAR’s Training Director for Controller Upgrades, following performed Controller Practical Tests (CPTs). An Official FIR must provide, through its website, the necessary information for virtual Pilots and ATCs to operate within its Airspace. This should include:

- Training Department (custom tutorials, with links to other training material)
- Downloadable charts
- Other downloads (e.g. sector files, POF-files, scenery information, etc)
- FIR information (routes, navigation, regulations)
- Staff member lists (contact information)
- Member lists
- Link to related Virtual Aviation and Controlling websites
- An overview of all Official FIRs are displayed on VATCAR’s webpage

Each FIR’s is free to generate, update and replace facility policies and/or regulations. Any changes or revisions will have to be approved by VATCAR before becoming official. This approval requires the vote of VATCAR1, VATCAR2 and VATCAR3. Each FIR is also free to organize its internal events, but for best purposes, we recommend events be coordinated via VATCAR 6 – Events Coordinator in advance. This step will help to insure order and promote the event across multiple VATCAR and VATSIM Services.
