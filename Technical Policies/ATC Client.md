The current VATSIM stance holds that you as a Virtual Air Traffic Controller on the network are able to choose from any of the approved ATC clients. VATSIM further encourages controllers to consider the popularity of any given client within a division when making their selection. This is in an effort to facilitate your training and development as a Virtual Air Traffic Controller. In that spirit, we at VATCAR are aligning our policies and procedures.

In order to standardize and facilitate training, all VATCAR controllers, both home and visiting, are required to complete all training sessions via the use of the Euroscope Air Traffic Control Client. For example:

- Initial Training Sessions
- Advance Training Sessions
- Remedial Training Sessions
- Over The Shoulder Exams
- Visitor Check-Outs
- Individual Endorsements

Although VATCAR requires that all training sessions and evaluations occur via the Euroscope ATC Client; Air Traffic Managers may individually recommend a preferred client within a sub-division. During normal operations controllers may choose to use any VATSIM approved ATC Client provided the controller ensures the use of up-to-date sector, pof, and alias files.

The following is a list of VATCAR approved ATC Clients:

- Euroscope (preferred)
- CRC
- VatSys
- VRC (unsupported)
