In VATCAR we want to encourage a welcoming and inclusive community to ensure every one of our members has the best experience possible. The VATCAR discord server is an official VATSIM communication medium, which means that all members are subject to the Code of Conduct and User Agreement. Members who choose to break our discord house rules can be kicked or even banned from the server. If you wish to report a member breaking the rules, please approach a staff member, either in Discord or via email.

1. No swearing or vulgar language. VATSIM welcomes members aged 13+ and we have a duty of care to protect our younger members from being exposed to bad language. Additionally, some members feel uncomfortable at the use
of bad language or may be offended by it.
2. No personal attacks, bullying, or intimidation. We strive to encourage a positive community atmosphere to ensure the best enjoyment is had in our hobby. Any form of personal attack, bullying, or intimidation is not tolerated.
3. No posting links to inappropriate or illegal content. The discord server may not be used to share links to vulgar or pornographic material, nor may it be used to link to any site which encourages illegal activities.
4. No spamming. This rule is quite self-explanatory.
5. Respect other members. If you enter a room where there is controller co-ordination going on, or a group flight is being enjoyed, please do not interrupt the activity by playing music or by disturbing the room occupants. Please respect the rules for different room categories.
6. No rude behavior. This covers a range of behaviors that would be constituted as being rude or impolite.

VATCAR strives to keep our community as integrated as possible. To that end, VATCAR has generated a discord server that houses all our sub-divisions. Air Traffic Manager may elect to open a facility specific discord server. Please note, that any such server is bound by both VATSIM and VATCAR policies, to include but NOT limited to the VATSIM Code of Conduct and this policy.
