The domain name “vatcar.net” is currently registered under the current Division Director. In the event of a change in Division Directors, the outgoing director will transfer all rights and access to the domain registration to the incoming Director. The Deputy Division Director will also have access to transfer the domain name if the outgoing Director is unable. This will provide checks and balances regarding the access and ownership of the vatcar.net domain name.
